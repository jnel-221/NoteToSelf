  ## Usage

  Once dependencies are loaded, run 'node index.js' to activate the express server.  The application will use your localhost at port 8083, or available port in your environment.  Once the server is connected, you can navigate to your browser and enter "localhost:8083" (or other port being used).  You are now ready to add, save, and delete notes!
